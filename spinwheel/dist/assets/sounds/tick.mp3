# Tick Sound File Placeholder

This file should contain a short (50-100ms) tick/click sound in MP3 format.

Recommended specifications:
- Duration: 50-100ms
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz
- Bit depth: 16-bit
- Format: MP3

You can:
1. Record a real wheel tick sound
2. Download a free tick sound from freesound.org
3. Use an online sound generator
4. Create one in a DAW like Audacity

The sound should be a sharp, mechanical click similar to:
- Roulette wheel clicks
- Wheel of fortune notches
- Mechanical switch clicks
- Pinball machine sounds

Place your tick.mp3 file here to replace the synthetic fallback sound.
